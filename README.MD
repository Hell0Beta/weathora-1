### **1. Problem**

* Current weather apps rely on **short-term forecasts** from APIs, typically accurate up to 7–10 days.
* **Long-range forecasts** (2–3 months) are often unreliable and not personalized.
* Farmers, logistics companies, energy providers, and local communities need **reliable seasonal forecasts** to plan ahead.

---

### **2. Our Solution**

* **Weathora** combines **real-time weather API data** with **NASA’s climate datasets (NVAP & CERES)**.
* We train an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) AI model** to recognize both **short-term weather patterns** and **long-term climate cycles**.
* The app provides **daily forecasts (1–7 days)** and **extended forecasts (1–3 months)** with improved accuracy.

---

### **3. How It Works**

**Dual Data Approach**

* **Short-term layer**: Open-source weather APIs (temperature, humidity, rain, wind).
* **Climate layer**:

  * **NVAP (water vapor trends)** – captures moisture fluctuations.
  * **CERES (radiation balance)** – captures solar & thermal energy shifts.

**AI Model**

* **LSTM Neural Network** trained with two feature sets:

  * *Weather Features*: TPW (precipitable water) means, trends, rolling averages.
  * *Climate Features*: Top-of-atmosphere radiation, seasonal cycles.
* Outputs:

  * **Daily forecasts (short horizon)**.
  * **Monthly forecasts (extended horizon)**.

---

### **4. Competitive Advantage**

* **Hybrid model**: Weathora fuses short-term APIs with NASA climate science → more accurate than regular apps.
* **Seasonal planning**: Enables farmers, businesses, and individuals to plan crops, events, logistics months ahead.
* **Open-source backbone**: Low-cost, scalable, transparent science-based forecasting.

---

### **5. Market Opportunity**

* **Agriculture**: Seasonal rainfall & drought prediction → crop yield optimization.
* **Energy**: Solar/wind output forecasting.
* **Insurance & Logistics**: Disaster risk, shipping delays.
* **Consumers**: A smarter weather app for daily + seasonal planning.

Global weather forecasting market = **$3.5B+ (2025 est.)**.

---

### **6. Business Model**

* **Free App (Weathora Basic)** – daily forecasts & alerts.
* **Premium Tier (Weathora Pro)** – extended 2–3 month forecasts, early warnings, agri/energy insights.
* **B2B API** – integrate extended forecasts into logistics, agriculture, and insurance platforms.

---

### **7. Traction / Proof of Concept**

* NASA datasets (NVAP & CERES) already preprocessed.
* Prototype LSTM trained → shows promising accuracy for 1–3 month seasonal predictions.
* API integration with open-source weather providers completed (short-term accuracy verified).

---

### **8. Roadmap**

* **Phase 1**: App release with 7-day forecasts + alerts (Q1).
* **Phase 2**: LSTM-powered long-range predictions (Q2).
* **Phase 3**: Partnerships with agri-coops, logistics firms, and energy providers (Q3).
* **Phase 4**: Expansion to Africa & Asia markets where seasonal forecasting has the highest impact.

### **9. Team**

* **Tedlee Appiah-Kubi** – CTO, AI/Software development.
* **[Co-founder]** – Climate science & data partnerships.
* **[Advisors]** – Meteorology & NASA data experts.

---

### **10. Vision**

> *“Weathora will become the go-to platform for reliable, science-backed seasonal forecasting, empowering people and businesses to make weather-smart decisions months ahead.”*

### **11. Getting Started With WEATHORA**

#### **Run the LSTM Model (`app.py`)**

1. **Install dependencies**  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. **Run the model**  
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    This will start the backend service and generate forecasts using the trained LSTM model.

#### **Install the Weathora App (APK)**

1. **Download the APK**  
    Get the latest `weathora.apk` from the [releases page](#) or your distribution source.
2. **Enable installation from unknown sources**  
    On your Android device, go to **Settings > Security > Unknown sources** and enable it.
3. **Install the APK**  
    Open the downloaded APK file and follow the on-screen instructions to install Weathora.
4. **Launch the app**
